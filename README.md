# Introductory course to Mathematica

This repository contains a series of notebooks based on Philip Candelas' introductory course on Mathematica: "Symbolic, Numerical and Graphical Scientific computing". This course was available as part of a few Masters' programmes in the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford.

The notebooks are based on the 2019 version of the course and I provide my own solutions to the homework assessments. Note that the 4th problem sheet was a purely graphical task. (The task is explained within my solution.)
